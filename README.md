- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the term "debugging" originated from an actual bug? In 1947, Grace Hopper and her team found a moth causing issues in the Harvard Mark II computer. Removing the moth literally "debugged" the system, and the term has been used ever since to describe fixing computer glitches LOL .
